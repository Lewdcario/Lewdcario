# Hello, I'm Okami ðŸ‘‹  <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Lewdcario" alt="" align="center" />

I'm a U.S.-based Full Stack Developer with a focus on [`React`] and [`TypeScript`]. I'm also experienced in [`C++`], [`C#`], and [`Java`].

- Pronouns: She/Her
- Fun Fact: I've been coding since 2015. I believe in hands-on experience as one of the most effective ways to learn.

## Experience ðŸ“š

I started my programming journey around **2015**, initially with [`Java`] to learn about game development. Over the years, I moved onto [`Javascript`] to make Discord Bots, like Floof Bot. Now, I specialize in [`React`] and [`TypeScript`]. I'm also an employee at [`Progressive Victory`](https://github.com/Progressive-Victory) and a past maintainer of [`discord.js`].
