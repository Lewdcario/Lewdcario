# Hello, I'm Okami ðŸ‘‹  <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Lewdcario" alt="" align="center" />

I'm a U.S.-based Full Stack Developer with a focus on [`React`] and [`Typescript`]. I'm also experienced in [`C++`], [`C#`], and [`Java`].

- Pronouns: She/Her
- Fun Fact: I've been coding since 2015. I believe in hands-on experience as one of the most effective ways to learn.

## Experience ðŸ“š

I started my programming journey around **2015**, initially with [`Java`] and [`Javascript`] to learn about game development. Over the years, I moved towards the [`Node.js`] framework to make Discord Bots, like [`Floof Bot`](https://smashcords.com/floofybot). Now, I specialize in [`React`] and [`Typescript`]. I'm a past maintainer of [`discord.js`](https://discord.js.org/), which is where a majority of my open source development went towards. I wrote sections of the guide linked previously, to make use of my customer support and documentation experience I had accrued at the time. You can see a preview of what I've done on my [`portfolio`](https://okami.codes). A lot of the current work I do is proprietary, so you can preview that on my portfolio website.
